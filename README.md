# Bank Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in banks using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is essential for banks to identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling targeted retention strategies.

## Project Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed analysis of the dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and potential outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
